#### <u>Vécu de l’inclusion scolaire au secondaire des élèves ayant un trouble du spectre de l’autisme : regards croisés des adolescents et de leurs parents, en France et au Québec. </u>
*Abstract. Introduction. – An increasing number of students diagnosed with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) is able to attend mainstream high schools
in both France and Quebec. Over the years, this increasing number of ASD youths has come to represent a greater proportion of all children
with special education needs in regular schools. However, little is known about how the French and Quebecois teenagers with ASD cope with
different aspects of inclusion. For these students, whose inherent difficulties lie in social interaction and communication, taking into account social
challenges of mainstreaming experience is essential.*
